            <h2 className="step">Step Two</h2>
            <p className="descrip">Player 1 should then populate a makeshift board with custom names - these can be anything from people you know, characters in a show, or complete strangers. The last one might make the game boring and unplayable but hey, you do you.</p>
            <h2 className="step">Step Three</h2>
            <p className="descrip">Players take turns asking each other "Yes or No" questions and marking off their board based off of their answers.</p>
            <h2 className="step">Step Four</h2>
            <p className="descrip">Players can only make a formal guess on their turn, and the first person to guess correctly wins!</p>
            <h2 className="step">Step Five</h2>
            <p className="descrip">Have fun!</p>
