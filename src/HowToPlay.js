            <p className="descrip">Because we don't care enough to learn your  names, for the sake of this explanation, we will refer to you as Player 1 and Player 2. The smarter one is Player 1, you know who you are.</p>
            <h2 className="step">Step One</h2>
            <p className="descrip">On the home screen, Player 1 will hit "Start your own Game" while Player 2 waits patiently.</p>
            <h2 className="step">Step Two</h2>
            <p className="descrip">Player 1 should then populate a makeshift board with custom names - these can be anything from people you know, characters in a show, or complete strangers. The last one might make the game boring and unplayable but hey, you do you.</p>
            <p className="descrip">Upon entering 24 names, Player 1 can then hit "Start Game" which will reveal a room code which they should then share with Player Two, who should still be patiently waiting.</p>
            <h2 className="step">Step Three</h2>
            <p className="descrip">Players take turns asking each other "Yes or No" questions and marking off their board based off of their answers. When you think you can eliminate a card, click on it to cross the name off.</p>
            <h2 className="step">Step Four</h2>
            <p className="descrip">Players can only make a formal guess on their turn (which you can do by hovering over the card with the person you want to guess and clicking on the green button that says "Guess") and the first person to guess correctly wins!</p>
            <h2 className="step">Step Five</h2>
            <p className="descrip">Have fun!</p>
            <p className="descrip">Or don't, to be honest, we don't care.</p>
