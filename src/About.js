            <p className="descrip">Guess Who was created by a group of bored college students. It is to be noted that they were not bored because they had nothing to do, all three were full time college students with plenty to occupy themselves with, they just wanted something new to do.</p>
            <p className="descrip">One fateful evening, deep into the pandemic, the group of friends had all but exhausted the internet's large collection of virtual games. One of them wondered if it was possible to create your own custom Guess Who game. Of course, a Google search might have revealed that yes this probably did exist. But nonetheless, filled with radical, unearned confidence, they decided to make their own.</p>
            <p className="descrip">And thus, this game was born.</p>
            <p className="descrip disclaimer">Disclaimer: No part of this game is their own idea, it is simply a customizable variation of the existing and supreme Hasbro game <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-Guess-Who-Classic-Game/dp/B01N6PRX20">Guess Who.</a></p>

            <p className="descrip"><strong>Claire Beard</strong> is a senior studying computer science who is far smarter than her two friends and somehow also TikTok famous, but still useless after three shots which cancels out the first two facts.</p>
